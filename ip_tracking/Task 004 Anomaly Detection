# ALX Backend Security Project - IP Tracker

## Overview
This project is a Django-based IP Tracker with enhanced security and analytics features. It implements IP logging, geolocation, rate limiting, and anomaly detection to secure and monitor your backend application.

## Features

### 1. IP Logging
- Logs every incoming request along with timestamp and path.
- Middleware checks if IP is blocked before processing requests.
- IP logs stored in `RequestLog` model.

### 2. IP Geolocation Analytics
- Uses `django-ipgeolocation` to track country and city for each IP.
- Geolocation data cached for 24 hours to reduce API calls.
- Enhances logging in `RequestLog` model.

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Uses `django-ratelimit` to limit requests:
  - Authenticated users: 10 requests/min
  - Anonymous users: 5 requests/min
- Applied to sensitive views like login to prevent abuse.

### 4. Anomaly Detection
- Uses Celery to run hourly checks for suspicious activity.
- Suspicious IPs are flagged and stored in `SuspiciousIP` model.
- Rules:
  - IPs exceeding 100 requests/hour.
  - Accessing sensitive paths (`/admin`, `/login`).
- Helps detect potential attacks and unusual behavior.
